				<h1>Musiclaps FAQs</h1>

				<h3>1. What is Musiclaps?</h3>
					<p>
						Musiclaps is a new online collaboration service that allows worldwide communication through music.  
						Members can record, upload, and share their tracks, allowing members of their choosing to collaborate with them.<br><br>
       					
       					In addition to actively participating, members can simply listen to each other's music.  
       					Musiclaps has the functionality of social networking sites with such features as posting comments, sharing, embedding, favoriting, as well as a unique feature - clapping!
       				</p>

       			<h3>2. What are the system requirements?</h3>
       				<p>
       					More than 2GB of RAM and Microsoft Windows XP (SP3), Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7, or Mac OS 10.5+.
       				</p>

       			<h3>3. What are the browser requirements?</h3>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/browser/" target="blank">Google Chrome</a> is highly recommended.  
						Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer 10+ are also good.
       				</p>

       			<h3>4. What is the "Live Player"?</h3>
       				<p>
       					The Live Player is Musiclaps’s original online application for recording and playing multiple tracks.
       				</p>

       			<h3>5. What is the "Recording Player"</h3>
       				<p>
       					The Recording Player is Musiclaps’s original application for recording.  
       					It can also be used as an accompaniment when playing alone.
       				</p>

		       	<h3>6. What is a part?</h3>
	       			<p>
		       			On Musiclaps, a part is an instrument or sound role.
		       		</p>

		       	<h3>7. What is a track?</h3>
		       		<p>
		       			A track is both a single recorded sound layer and a recording comprised of multiple tracks!  
		       			Final recordings are typically comprised of multiple, layered tracks with one part per track.  
       					For example, in a recording with piano, guitar, drums, and vocals, there would typically be at least 4 tracks, one for each part.
		       		</p>

		       <h3>8. Who is the project owner?</h3>
		       		<p>
			       		The individual who has recorded and made public a cover or original song using the Live or Recording Player.
		       		</p>

		       	<h3>9. How does Musiclaps address song copyrights?</h3>
		       		<p>	
			       		For original songs, the project owner can select a traditional copyright or Creative Commons license.  
			       		If the project owner specifies that the song is a cover, or if a copyright type is not selected, the project is automatically classified as a cover.  
			       		Please only select a copyright type if your project is using an original song!<br>
			       		<strong>Note</strong>: Once saved for a particular project, the copyright type cannot be changed.
			       	</p>

       			<h3>10. What are the types of collaborations?</h3>
       				<p>
       					On Musiclaps, there are three types of collaborations: Open Collab, Requesting Collab and No Collab.  
       					For Open and Requesting Collab, a member can add to another member’s project by adding their own track or instrument using the Live Player.  
       					Up to 14 tracks can be added per project.
       				</p>

       			<h3>11. What is "Open Collab"?</h3>
       				<p>
       					Open Collab allows any member to participate.  
       					Members can add their track or instrument, swap out existing tracks with theirs, change the project key, arrange and publicize the project.  
       					Open Collab projects designated as "public" will display on the "Collaborations" page, which is visible by both members and non-members.
       				</p>

       			<h3>12. What is "Requesting Collab"?</h3>
       				<p>
	       				Requesting Collab means that the project owner is requesting specific instrumentation.  
	       				Members participate by responding to the project owner's request.  
	       				Once the member has recorded and uploaded the requested part, the project owner is automatically notified.<br><br>

	       				The project owner is able to listen to each part from a list of participating member names.  
	       				If there are several participants for one part, the project owner chooses their preference for the collaboration.<br><br>  
	       				
	       				Once the collaboration is done and the project is made public, the display setting changes to Requesting Collab Completed and the project displays on the "Collaborations" page.
	       			</p>

	       		<h3>13. What is "No Collab"?</h3>
       				<p>
       					No Collab projects are the default and for listening only.<br>
       					<strong>Note</strong>: You can change the status from No Collab to Open or Requesting Collab, but the status cannot be changed back to No Collab.
       				</p>

		       	<h3>15. Where do I go to change my project's status (Private, Public, Group, Audition)?</h3>
		       		<p> 
			       		Since newly recorded projects are not automatically listed, you need to follows these steps to change the status:
		       			<ul>
		       				<li>-Click on <span class="bold">My Projects</span> (user menu)</li>
		       				<li>-Select <span class="bold">In Progress/Private</span> from the dropdown</li>
		       				<li>-Click on the rectangular project tile</li>
		       				<li>-Below the Live Player on the right-hand side, select the desired status</li>
		       			</ul>
				        A project's status can be changed at any time.
		       		</p>

			    <h3>16. What are "In Progress/Private" projects?</h3>
					<p>Unlisted projects.  
						You can copy and privately share the URL of these projects with friends or any individuals you choose.
					</p>
				      		
				<h3>17. What are group projects?</h3>
				   	<p>Group projects are shared exclusively with members of a selected group.
				       Any member's part can be changed to unlisted.
				    </p>

			    <h3>18. How does the lyrics feature work?</h3>
			    	<p>
						On the Lyrics page (<span class="bold">My Projects</span> --> <span class="bold">Lyrics</span>), all of your projects are displayed on a pull-down list.  
						Choose the project you want to add lyrics to and fill in the necessary fields and lyrics.  
						You can adjust the scrolling speed by specifying a pause start/stop time and speed.
					</p>

				<h3>19. How do I change my project image?:</h3>
		       		<ul>
       					<li>-Click on the existing image or the default Musiclaps image</li>
       				</ul>
			        <p>The Change Project Image bar will display below, and you can change the image to one of your liking.
			        	We recommend uploading an image size of 120 x 70px.
			        </p>

				<h3>20. What are "YouTube Links"?</h3>
		       		<p>
			       		The YouTube Links feature enables a member to add a corresponding video to their project.  
       					For example, a cover song can link to the original music video posted on YouTube, or an original song can link to the member's own YouTube video.
		       		</p>

				<h3>21. What is a “Group”?</h3>
		       		<p>
			       		Members who are "friends" (i.e. who have connected on the "Messages" page) can form a group.  
				        Groups are created on a per project basis, and the project status must be "Group" (see question #15 for instructions on how to change the status).<br><br> 
				        
				        The project owner chooses the project they want to collaborate on and enters the group name and usernames of the participating members.  
				        A new group displays and the participating members are added and notified.  
				        Only participating/listed members are able to listen to and participate in the group song, and only the project owner is allowed to add or change the group information.<br><br> 
				        
				        Once the collaboration is finished and the project owner changes the status to something other than "Group", the group ends and is removed from the list.
		       		</p>

			       		These projects will appear on the Favorites page.
			       	</p>

			    <h3>23. What instruments can I record with?</h3>
		       		<p>	
			       		You can easily record any instrument that connects with a cable (e.g. electric guitar, electric bass, keyboard, etc.).  
			       		Acoustic instruments (e.g. piano, acoustic guitar, trumpet, drums, vocals, etc.) can be recorded using a mic.
			       	</p>

			   <h3>24. Can I record an instrument that is not listed on the site (i.e. does not have an icon)?</h3>
		       		<p>	
			       		Yes.  
			       		If you are playing an instrument that is not on the list, please select “Other".
			       	</p>

			    <h3>25. Can I use my computer‘s built-in mic for recording?</h3>
		       		<p>	
			       		It’s possible but not recommended since it will create feedback.
			       	</p>

			    <h3>26. It’s acting a little weird.  What should I do?</h3>
